    mainly the same information as $$Root$$.reg, with some small exceptions
    and with a slightly different format.  If you wish, you may copy it over
    to your Macintosh with mfile:
        mfile copy -l -t TEXT -c RgEd $$root$$Mac.reg ":<MacintoshPath>"
    You may then double-click on the Macintosh file you just copied over, and
    that will launch the Macintosh registration database editor and merge the
    file into the database.  Remember, the framework will automatically enter
    this information into the Macintosh registration database the first time
    your application is run.  Still, your setup program should enter this
    information into the database when your application is installed.

$$ENDIF
$$IF(MINI_SERVER || FULL_SERVER || CONTAINER_SERVER)
$$SRVRITEM_HFILE$$.h, $$SRVRITEM_IFILE$$.cpp - this class is used to

    These files contain your $$DLGAUTOPROXY_CLASS$$ class.  This class
    is called the "automation proxy" class for your dialog, because it
    takes care of exposing the automation methods and properties that
    automation controllers can use to access your dialog.  These methods
    and properties are not exposed from the dialog class directly, because
    in the case of a modal dialog-based MFC application it is cleaner and

Help Support:

MakeHelp.bat

hlp\$$Root$$.hpj
    This file is the Help Project file used by the Help compiler to create
    your application's Help file.

hlp\*.bmp
    These are bitmap files required by the standard Help file topics for
    Microsoft Foundation Class Library standard commands.

Other standard files:

StdAfx.h, StdAfx.cpp
    These files are used to build a precompiled header (PCH) file
    named $$Root$$.pch and a precompiled types file named StdAfx.obj.

Resource.h
    This is the standard header file, which defines new resource IDs.
    Microsoft Developer Studio reads and updates this file.

Other notes:

AppWizard uses "TODO:" to indicate parts of the source code you
should add to or customize.
$$IF(PROJTYPE_MDI || PROJTYPE_SDI || PROJTYPE_DLG)

If your application uses MFC in a shared DLL, and your application is 
in a language other than the operating system's current language, you
will need to copy the corresponding localized resources MFC40XXX.DLL
from the Microsoft Visual C++ CD-ROM onto the system or system32 directory,
and rename it to be MFCLOC.DLL.  ("XXX" stands for the language abbreviation.
For example, MFC40DEU.DLL contains resources translated to German.)  If you
don't do this, some of the UI elements of your application will remain in the
language of the operating system.
