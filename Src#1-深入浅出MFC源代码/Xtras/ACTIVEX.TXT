==================

IMPORTANT NOTE:

When using the ActiveXControlQuery() function you should note that
it checks for the existence of a particular ClassID.  If that ID 
is found, the function will return an affirmative response regardless
of the version of the installed control.  This leaves open the 
possibility that an older version of a control can coincidentally be 
found on the target machine and produce unpredictable results.  For 
this reason you should always force an install of your intended 
controls unless you are certain that all machines on which your piece 
will run would never have older versions of your controls already 
installed.
